# Memory Game
Are you ready to test your memory? This memory game will test your ability to recall placement of cards from your short term memory

## How the game works
The game board consists of sixteen "cards" arranged in a grid. The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side. The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down. The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!

Each turn:
* The player flips one card over to reveal its underlying symbol.
* The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with the same symbol.
* If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over.
* If the cards do not match, both cards are flipped face down.
* The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.

## How are the scores evaluated
* If you finish the game in 10 moves or less, you score 3 stars
* If you finish the game in 20 or less moves, but more than 10 moves, you score 2 stars
* If you finish the game in more than 20 moves, you score 1 star
